Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.\nThe kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.\nSuccessor(x, curOrder):\n    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:\n        if x is the king return null\n        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)\n    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder\n\nFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.\n\nIn the beginning, curOrder will be [\"king\"].\nCalling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\"].\nCalling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"].\nCalling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"].\nCalling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"].\n\nUsing the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.\nImplement the ThroneInheritance class:\n\nThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.\nvoid birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.\nvoid death(string name) Indicates the death of name.
