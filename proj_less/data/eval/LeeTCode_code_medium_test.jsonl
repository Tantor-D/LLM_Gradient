The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i.\nEach plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:\n\nAlice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the 0th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the (n - 1)th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.\nIt takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.\nAlice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.\nIn case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.\n\nGiven a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and two integers capacityA and capacityB representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\n- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.\n- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.\n- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.\n- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it.

But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.\n\nRules and restrictions:\n\nYou can only travel among n cities, represented by indexes from 0 to n - 1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.\nThe cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as an n x n matrix (not necessarily symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] == 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] == 1. Also, flights[i][i] == 0 for all i.\nYou totally have k weeks (each week has seven days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we do not consider the impact of flight time.\nFor each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an n x k matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take a vacation in the city i in the week j.\nYou could stay in a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which will not be counted as vacation days.\nIf you fly from city A to city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.\nWe do not consider the impact of flight hours on the calculation of vacation days.\n\nGiven the two matrices flights and days, return the maximum vacation days you could take during k weeks.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation:\nOne of the best strategies is:\n1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day.\n(Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.)\n2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\n3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\nAns = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nSince there are no flights that enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. \nFor each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work.\nSo the maximum number of vacation days is 3.\nAns = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]\nOutput: 21\nExplanation:\nOne of the best strategies is:\n1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days.\n2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.\n3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.\nAns = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == flights.length\nn == flights[i].length\nn == days.length\nk == days[i].length\n1 <= n, k <= 100\nflights[i][j] is either 0 or 1.\n0 <= days[i][j] <= 7\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "class Solution(object):\n    def maxVacationDays(self, flights, days):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type flights: List[List[int]]\n        :type days: List[List[int]]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        n, t = len(flights), len(days[0])\n        prev = [-float('inf')] * n\n        prev[0] = 0\n        \n        for i in range(t):\n            cur = [-float('inf')] * n\n            for x in range(n):\n                for y in range(n):\n                    if (x == y or flights[x][y]) and cur[y] < prev[x] + days[y][i]:\n                        cur[y] = prev[x] + days[y][i]\n            prev = cur\n\n            \n        res = -float('inf')\n        for i in range(n):\n            if prev[i] > res: res = prev[i]\n        return res"}]}

The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: chargeTimes = [11,12,19], runningCosts = [10,8,7], budget = 19\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: No robot can be run that does not exceed the budget, so we return 0.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nchargeTimes.length == runningCosts.length == n\n1 <= n <= 5 * 10000\n1 <= chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i] <= 100000\n1 <= budget <= 10^15\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "class Solution(object):\n    def maximumRobots(self, chargeTimes, runningCosts, budget):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type chargeTimes: List[int]\n        :type runningCosts: List[int]\n        :type budget: int\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        h = []\n        n = len(chargeTimes)\n        i=0\n        j=0\n        s = 0\n        rr = 0\n        while i<n:\n            c, r = chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i]\n            s+=r\n            heappush(h, (-c, i))\n            # print i, j\n            while True:\n                while h:\n                    hc, hi = h[0]\n                    if hi>=j: break\n                    heappop(h)\n                if not h: break\n                x = -h[0][0]+(i-j+1)*s\n                if x<=budget:\n                    rr=max(i-j+1, rr)\n                    break\n                s-=runningCosts[j]\n                j+=1 \n            i+=1\n        return rr"}]}

The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls onto the hole.\n\nGiven the m x n maze, the ball's position ball and the hole's position hole, where ball = [ballrow, ballcol] and hole = [holerow, holecol], return a string instructions of all the instructions that the ball should follow to drop in the hole with the shortest distance possible.

The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'.\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\nThe string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\nThe string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\nFor example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\nSimilarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\nFor example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.

The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'.\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\nThe string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\nThe string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\nFor example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\nSimilarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\nFor example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\nOutput: [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\nExplanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nThe string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9.

From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.\nYou may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:\n\nDuring odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\nDuring even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\nIt may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.\n\nA starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).\nReturn the number of good starting indices.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.\nIn total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of\njumps.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:\nDuring our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].\nDuring our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].\nWe can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some\nnumber of jumps.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 10000\n0 <= arr[i] < 100000\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "class Solution(object):\n    def oddEvenJumps(self, A):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type A: List[int]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        n = len(A)\n        odd = [0] * n\n        even = [0] * n\n        sa1 = sorted([[a, i] for i, a in enumerate(A)])\n        sa2 = sorted([[a, i] for i, a in enumerate(A)], key = lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            j = i+1\n            while j < n and sa1[i][1] > sa1[j][1]:\n                j += 1\n            if j < n:\n                odd[sa1[i][1]] = sa1[j][1]\n            else:\n                odd[sa1[i][1]] = -1\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            j = i-1\n            while j >= 0 and sa2[i][1] > sa2[j][1]:\n                j -= 1\n            if j >= 0:\n                even[sa2[i][1]] = sa2[j][1]\n            else:\n                even[sa2[i][1]] = -1\n        \n        dp = [[False, False] for _ in range(n)]\n        dp[-1] = [True, True]\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n            if odd[i] != -1 and dp[odd[i]][1]:\n                dp[i][0] = True\n                res += 1\n            if even[i] != -1 and dp[even[i]][0]:\n                dp[i][1] = True\n        return res\n            \n        \n        "}]}

Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].\nSince the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:\n\nCount all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.\n\n\t\nFor example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.\n\n\nDenote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros.

Otherwise, the code is invalid.\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\nA valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\nA valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\nA < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\nThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\nCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid.

Note that finalSum cannot be split into (2 + 2 + 4 + 4) as all the numbers should be unique.\n\nReturn a list of integers that represent a valid split containing a maximum number of integers. If no valid split exists for finalSum, return an empty list. You may return the integers in any order.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: finalSum = 12\nOutput: [2,4,6]\nExplanation: The following are valid splits: (12), (2 + 10), (2 + 4 + 6), and (4 + 8).\n(2 + 4 + 6) has the maximum number of integers, which is 3. Thus, we return [2,4,6].\nNote that [2,6,4], [6,2,4], etc. are also accepted.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: finalSum = 7\nOutput: []\nExplanation: There are no valid splits for the given finalSum.\nThus, we return an empty array.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: finalSum = 28\nOutput: [6,8,2,12]\nExplanation: The following are valid splits: (2 + 26), (6 + 8 + 2 + 12), and (4 + 24). \n(6 + 8 + 2 + 12) has the maximum number of integers, which is 4. Thus, we return [6,8,2,12].\nNote that [10,2,4,12], [6,2,4,16], etc. are also accepted.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= finalSum <= 10^10\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "class Solution(object):\n    def maximumEvenSplit(self, finalSum):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type finalSum: int\n        :rtype: List[int]\n        \"\"\"\n        if finalSum & 1 == 1:\n            return []\n        else:\n            res = []\n            n = int(math.sqrt(finalSum))\n            t = n * (n + 1)\n            if t <= finalSum:\n                res = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]\n                res[-1] += finalSum - t\n            else:\n                res = [2 * i for i in range(1, n)]\n                res[-1] += finalSum - n * (n - 1)\n        return res"}]}

She adds (-10) + (-12) = -22 to her\n  score and places a stone of value -22 on the left. stones = [-22].\nThe difference between their scores is (-22) - 0 = -22.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == stones.length\n2 <= n <= 100000\n-10000 <= stones[i] <= 10000\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "class Solution:\n    def stoneGameVIII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        pre_sum = [sum(stones[:2])]\n        for t in stones[2:] :\n            pre_sum.append(t + pre_sum[-1])\n        \n        @functools.lru_cache(None)\n        def solve(pt=0, move='a') :\n            if pt == len(pre_sum) - 1 :\n                return pre_sum[-1] if move == 'a' else -pre_sum[-1]\n            \n            if move == 'a' :\n                return max(solve(pt+1, 'a'), pre_sum[pt]+solve(pt+1, 'b'))\n            else :\n                return min(solve(pt+1, 'b'), -pre_sum[pt]+solve(pt+1, 'a'))\n        return solve()"}]}
